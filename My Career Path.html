                                Projected Career Path </li>

                                  <p>Finances and Investments have been the most attractive fields to me. Working for the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, or any multilateral agency is my goal. 
                                    My experience in the MPA Program has streched my abilities and has helped me seeing where I do fit in the longer run. 
                                    I have come to realize that my passion, my pruposes, and the places where I have been, all converged to what I call "Disciple-leadership". I have learned through experience that my greatest joy has been in
                                    a life of service. The Nonprofit field has all these features in common, a lifelong service career while making an impact in the lives of thousands of people, and making a living by doing it.
                                    </p>
                                   
        
                                <li class="list-unstyled-item list-hours-item d-flex">
                                    My Experience in this field </li>
                                <p>Serving has come naturally to me in my early ages. After my mission, I quickly got called to serve in the bishopric as a second counselor, and then as a bishop. I served in these capacities for 8 years, helping local unit members to strenghten their testimonies in God and Jesus Christ.
                                This coincide with my employment in the Chirch, first as Buyer and Fleet Administrator, Travel Supervisor, and most recently, Support Services Manager. Working for the church has opened a lot of doors of knowledge and opportunities. Working in an environment where the organizational culture is the one of Jesus Christ has been an amazing opportunity. 
                                Every single day would bring a very special feeling of grateful and happiness just by knowing that by serving priesthood leaders and members, we were serving God. Through various church, and work responsabilities, my communication skills did grow exponentially.
                                My leadershi skills developed in a very special way as I got to connect with my collegues that I led, and those from other various departments. 
                                My functional skills in area such as Operations, Finances, inventory management, procurement, sales, Information & Communication systems increased as well, making me a multifunctional employer and and an exceptional performer !
                                </p>  
                                
                                <li class="list-unstyled-item list-hours-item d-flex">
                                    My Expected Constribution to the field</li><br>
                                    
                                <p>Joining Grantwell, a student-lead association at the Marriot School of Business has provided me and my teammate a real opportunity to assist the City of Moab designing a RAP Tax program.
                                This program aims at granting a considerable amount of money through bonds, to Moab based organizations to promote Moab development. We assisted designing the grant process, from the grand committee formation to the application process and decision-making process. 
                                With this project, we have used Quantitative Decision Analysis, Finances, Project design and evaluation, and business communication skills to help the city.
                                I will be joining Lendio Inc, a FinTech company based in Lehi, and will be working with small businesses getting access to the  capital they desperately need to grow their businesses. My financial skills will be at play in this role, as well as my communication, and interpersonal skills. Again, by helping small businesses who contribute largely to the USA GDP, we are helping thousands of people including, customers, workers, etc.
                                Naturally, I have come to fund The Lord's Hands NGO, a non profit, working in the educational field. We are currently helping BYU-Pathway Student in Africa to have access or own a laptop for their online studies. This tool is the major barrier to most of them in their quest of education.
